  <div type="button" class="collapsible">3. Are DigiLocker and VeriFile same type of service?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>No. In terms of architecture, security, and privacy, VeriFile is structurally different and far superior as compared to digital solutions such as DigiLocker.</p>
    <p>Solutions like DigiLocker are built on a ‘centralized’ architecture for data storage and verification that stores user data on a server that is controlled by a third party. So, during the verification process, the user data is inherently exposed to the internet through various APIs. This leaves scope for malicious actors who can find a vulnerability in the security of the API and can access user databases, thereby, compromising the privacy and security of the user data.</p>
    <p>Across the globe, numerous hacking incidents are vindicating the shortcomings of the centralized solutions and their vulnerability to malicious attacks. In fact, not only external hackers, even insiders with access to such centralized databases pose a threat to the integrity and privacy of the user databases.</p>
    <p>On the contrary, VeriFile applies a ‘decentralized’ approach. By leveraging the open-source blockchain system of the popular cryptocurrency Ethereum as the underlying stack, VeriFile has created a proprietary method to compute and process unique fingerprints or hashes of documents generated by the issuers.</p>
    <p>These hashes are irreversible in nature and are put on the blockchain against the Public Key assigned to the issuers. Any verifier can compare the hash generated for the VeriFile document with the data available on this blockchain, to verify the respective VeriFile document.</p>
    <p>
      Since, these irreversible document hashes which are nothing but a string of random characters, are the only things exposed to the internet, the problem of data privacy is simply non-existent. Furthermore, these hashes are stored on the blockchain rather than a centralized database, making the entire verification system tamper-proof, instantaneously auditable, and free from any central point of failure.

  <div type="button" class="collapsible">4. How safe is my data with VeriFile?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Nobody has access to the user’s personal data, not even VeriFile.
    </p>
    <p>While only issuers and document holders or beneficiaries gain access to the VeriFile document, VeriFile receives only irreversible hashes or unique fingerprints for documents from the issuers. These hashes are published on the blockchain for verification purposes.</p>
    <p>The only data that a malicious actor, externally or even internally within VeriFile, can see are the document hashes, which are nothing but strings of gibberish.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 67.5%; align-items: center;">
  <div type="button" class="collapsible">5. How does a VeriFile document look like?</div>
  <div class="content">

  <div type="button" class="collapsible">7. How do I verify a VeriFile document?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>As a verifier, you will need to upload the pdf document on the verification portal mentioned on the document itself. This portal is maintained by the issuer of the same document. Alternatively, you can also verify the documents by using the portal on our website.</p>
  </div>

  <div type="button" class="collapsible">11. What happens if someone modifies the VeriFile document?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Any changes made to an issued VeriFile document will drastically change the document hash, making it invalid during the verification.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 67.5%; align-items: center;">
  <div type="button" class="collapsible">12. How will an Issuer like me benefit from migrating to VeriFile?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Due to the advancements in computer graphics, paper-based documents have become more and more vulnerable to potential forgeries and thereby, becoming obsolete by the day. With a tedious manual verification process, stakeholders have shifted to digital solutions for document verification. However, even traditional digital solutions pose new challenges such as data privacy and security.</p>
    <p>LegitDoc provides an elegant issuance-verification system for tamper-proof digital documents. These documents are auditable instantaneously and don’t pose any threat to data security and data privacy.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 67.5%; align-items: center;">
  <div type="button" class="collapsible">13. Is my user data with VeriFile</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The issue of the safety of a user’s personal data doesn’t arise at all with LegitDoc. This is due to the fact that even LegitDoc’s backend doesn’t have any access to user’s documents or personal data. Only the issuers and the document holders or beneficiaries can access the respective documents.</p>
    <p>LegitDoc, in fact, receives only irreversible hashes or unique fingerprints of the documents from the issuers. These hashes are published on the blockchain for verification purposes. Be it externally or internally, any malicious actor considering breaking into the data, will only be able to see a string of gibberish from the document hashes.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 67.5%; align-items: center;">
  <div type="button" class="collapsible">14. How will my current system be affected if I decide to migrate to Verifile? Will I have to discontinue the existing setup?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Not at all. There won’t be any disruptions to the current system you follow. It will continue to run in parallel with LegitDoc enabling a smooth transition for your stakeholders.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 67.5%; align-items: center;">
  <div type="button" class="collapsible">15. What kind of infrastructure would I need to establish to start using the Blockchain technology of legitdoc?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>You don’t need any dedicated blockchain or IT infrastructure to start using LegitDoc. All you need is an internet connection and a computer to start issuing your documents from the LegitDoc platform. Once issued, you can just forget about the issued LegitDoc documents and the blockchain stack will take care of the rest.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 67.5%; align-items: center;">
  <div type="button" class="collapsible">16. Who owns the document data?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We repeat, no other third party including the LegitDoc team has any access to the user's document data. Only the issuer of documents and the beneficiary who has received the documents from the issuer will be the owners of document data.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 67.5%; align-items: center;">
  <div type="button" class="collapsible">17. Do my users need to depend on VeriFile website for verification of documents?</div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>While you can always count on us, we also encourage issuers to maintain an independent copy of the LegitDoc verification portal on their own website. This makes it convenient for users who are more familiar with the issuer’s website.</p>
    <p>However, if the issuers insist, documents issued by them can also be directly verified on the LegitDoc portal by simply visiting our website.</p>
